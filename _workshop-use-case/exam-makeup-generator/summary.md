# Exam make-up generator — a standalone Claude Code skill

A worked example of a **Claude Code skill** that turns the laborious task of writing a make-up exam into a curated multi-round flow: read the original exam, run an interview about per-slot topic scope, generate candidate replacement problems (2–3 per slot), iterate on instructor feedback, then assemble the chosen candidates into a finished make-up exam in the original's format. **CS20-tested** — the worked run in this folder is the real Round-1 + Round-2 + Assembly trace on the Harvard CS20 spring-2026 final exam.

> **Installation (no Vercel URL — this is a skill, not a webapp):** drop [`operations/skill.md`](operations/skill.md) and [`operations/skill.json`](operations/skill.json) into your project's `.claude/skills/exam-makeup/` (or your user-level `~/.claude/skills/exam-makeup/`). Rename `skill.md` → `SKILL.md` if your Claude Code version expects the uppercase filename. Then invoke the skill in any Claude Code session with `Use exam-makeup to ...` or pass an exam path directly.
>
> **No external service required.** The skill operates entirely through Claude Code's file tools — `Read` for the exam, `Write` for the candidate file, `Edit` for iteration. There is no API endpoint, no inference provider beyond the model Claude Code is already using.

This is the first **standalone-skill** gallery example. Where the previous examples ship either a deployed Vercel page or a CLI-style Claude Code project with skills nested inside, this one ships **only the skill** plus a worked run. It's the cleanest demonstration in the gallery of what a project-scoped or user-scoped skill can look like at substantial scale (~400 lines, three modes, an interview phase, dated audit trail, format-agnostic I/O).

## What it is

A self-contained skill consisting of:

- **[`operations/skill.md`](operations/skill.md)** — the skill itself, ~400 lines. Defines three modes (Generation, Iteration, Assembly) auto-detected from a single state-driving markdown file. Specifies the interview phase, the generation rules (parity, distinctness, partial-credit, format match), the iteration semantics (preserving consumed feedback as a quoted block), the assembly sanity checks (balanced environments, typo'd-tag regex, problem/subpart counts), and the format-agnostic read strategies for `.tex`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.md`, `.html`, `.txt`, `.rtf`, `.doc`.
- **[`operations/skill.json`](operations/skill.json)** — the one-line manifest (name, description, version, author).
- **[`operations/three-mode-state-machine.md`](operations/three-mode-state-machine.md)** — a reader's entry point. The shape of the skill before its substance.

Plus a worked run on the CS20 final:

- **[`inputs/final_s.tex`](inputs/final_s.tex)** — the original exam (LaTeX source, 10 problems, with solutions). The structural anchor for the run.
- **[`inputs/final_s.pdf`](inputs/final_s.pdf)** — the same exam, rendered, for visual reference.
- **[`outputs/final_s_makeup_candidates.md`](outputs/final_s_makeup_candidates.md)** — the real Generation + Iteration output. 1,741 lines, 10 slots, 37 candidates total across two rounds, complete LaTeX solutions per candidate, instructor's 10 Keep boxes pre-checked.
- **[`outputs/final_s_makeup.tex`](outputs/final_s_makeup.tex)** — the real Assembly output. A complete make-up exam in the same LaTeX format as the original.
- **[`outputs/worked-run-summary.md`](outputs/worked-run-summary.md)** — a reader's guide to those two output artifacts.

## The move worth noticing

**A skill whose entire architecture is a state machine driven by a single editable markdown file.** No database, no JSON state-store, no separate metadata. The candidates file is the curation log, the work-in-progress artifact, the audit trail, and the input-for-the-next-mode — all the same file. The instructor edits it directly (in VS Code, Cursor, GitHub web, anywhere that renders GitHub-Flavored-Markdown task-list checkboxes); the skill auto-detects what to do next from the file's state.

Three modes, one file:

| Mode | Trigger | Edit |
|---|---|---|
| **Generation** | File doesn't exist | Skill creates it |
| **Iteration** | `**Feedback for next round**` block is non-empty | Skill appends new candidates; preserves consumed feedback as a quoted block |
| **Assembly** | At least one `- [x] **Keep**` is checked; no pending feedback | Skill assembles into final exam |

The instructor never has to remember which mode they're in. They edit the file (or don't), re-invoke the skill, and the skill figures out what to do.

This is the **opposite** of the workflows-with-state typically described in agent-engineering literature, which lean toward separate state-stores, separate metadata, separate "configuration" surfaces. The exam-makeup skill commits to: *if the artifact you're producing is a markdown file the instructor reads anyway, then the file IS the state. Edit the artifact, re-invoke the skill, observe the new state.*

The second move worth noticing is the **interview phase with three named topic-scope tiers** (narrow / broader / broadest), plus two cross-cutting modifiers (*lateral broadening* and *broader still*). Without the interview, the skill infers topic scope from the original's surface form alone — and inferred topics are usually too narrow, producing candidate clones with weak security. The interview is the single moment of human-driven scope-choice in the whole run; it's the difference between *"three near-duplicates of the original disease-test Bayes problem"* and *"a Bayes problem on spam filtering, a Bayes problem on medical screening with two conditionally-independent tests, and a Bayes problem on cyber-intrusion detection."*

The third move is the **security-vs-parity foundational commitment**, made structurally legible in every candidate via the *Suitability* sentence:

- *"Tests the same three-skill build (mutual-inclusion identity → derived cardinality → characterizing condition) on a three-set distributivity rather than symmetric difference; the operation, the cardinality formula, and the characterizing condition are all unrelated to the original."*

The Suitability sentence names what was preserved (technique, structure, difficulty) and what was changed (domain, scenario, numbers). The instructor decides at-a-glance whether the candidate makes the security/parity trade-off the way they want. The decision surface is one sentence.

---

## How it was built

**Phase 1 — The security-vs-parity problem statement.** The skill started from a tight diagnosis: make-up exams are *hard* because the two constraints pull in opposite directions. "Different from the original" can mean *different topic* (easy, but breaks parity), *different framing* (might not be enough), or *different concrete domain holding everything else constant* (the right kind of different, hard to do well). The skill is designed entirely around this last move.

**Phase 2 — The state-machine.** Three modes, one file. The auto-detect logic is dense but surgical: file-doesn't-exist ⟶ generation; non-empty feedback block ⟶ iteration; checked Keep box + no pending feedback ⟶ assembly. The instructor's mental model is *edit the file, re-invoke the skill*, nothing more.

**Phase 3 — The interview phase.** Initial drafts of the skill went straight from analysis to generation. The candidates were *technically correct* (same skill, similar difficulty) but very clone-y — the topic was always inferred from the original's surface domain, which forced the variations to be in the *same neighborhood*. Adding the narrow/broader/broadest interview let the instructor say "actually I want any problem from the *combinatorics unit*, not just lattice paths." Candidate variety improved sharply.

**Phase 4 — Iteration as the curation log.** Early versions overwrote candidates in iteration. The instructor lost the history. The current design *appends* — new candidates go under existing ones with a dated separator; consumed feedback is preserved as a quoted block; the file accumulates rounds. Future readers (including the instructor weeks later) can see exactly what each round of feedback addressed.

**Phase 5 — Assembly sanity checks.** The first version of assembly produced LaTeX that occasionally didn't compile — a typo'd closing tag, an unbalanced environment, a missing `\end{solution}`. The current version runs format-specific sanity checks (counts of `\begin` vs. `\end`, regex for typo'd closing tags, problem-count and subpart-count verification against the test plan) before reporting success. If checks fail, the skill fixes what's safe to auto-fix and surfaces the rest.

**Phase 6 — Format-agnostic I/O.** The skill was originally LaTeX-only. The current version reads `.tex`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.md`, `.html`, `.txt`, `.rtf`, `.doc` and writes back in the original's format. The conversion path is documented in the skill (`pandoc`, `textutil`, fallback strategies). Scanned/image PDFs that resist text extraction are handled by stopping and asking the user — *better than guessing*.

### Things this approach taught us

The file-as-state design is enormously freeing. Once the instructor accepts that the candidates file *is* the state, they stop asking "what mode am I in?" and start treating it like any other markdown they edit. The skill's auto-detect logic does the work; the instructor does the curation. Splitting state across multiple files (a JSON config + a markdown working doc + a separate output file) would have been much worse.

The Suitability sentence is the most-edited single line per candidate. Long Suitability paragraphs encourage the instructor to *read the candidate* rather than *decide at-a-glance*; that's the wrong move for a curation tool. The skill enforces one sentence and prohibits more — and the instructor's decision surface gets sharper.

The interview phase pays back enormously. Calibrating per-slot topic scope before generation cuts the number of iteration rounds roughly in half compared to a no-interview baseline (informally measured across CS20's three iterations of the make-up workflow). It also produces better candidate variety per slot — *broader* and *broadest* tiers tend to expose the instructor to problems they'd have written but hadn't thought to.

Preserving consumed feedback in the file matters more than it might seem. The temptation is to clean up the file after each iteration round — but the cleaned-up file loses the audit trail. Instructors revisiting the curation log weeks later need to see what each round addressed. The current "consumed feedback as a quoted block" pattern is the right tradeoff between readability and audit fidelity.

The sanity-check step at assembly is doing real work. LaTeX environments unbalance silently, and a make-up exam that doesn't compile in front of TAs is worse than no make-up. Running balanced-begin/end checks + typo regex + problem-count verification before reporting success has caught at least three unbalanced-environment bugs across CS20 runs.

## What you can translate this to

The pattern is **a multi-mode skill where a single editable markdown file is both the curation surface and the state**. The make-up-exam use case is one application; the underlying shape generalizes to any task where:

- The skill produces something an expert would otherwise hand-curate.
- The expert wants to review, iterate, and choose — not autonomously regenerate.
- The chosen items need to be assembled into a final artifact at the end.

Specifically, the pattern ports cleanly to:

- **Reading-list curation for a course.** Skill reads a syllabus's existing reading list, generates 2–3 replacement readings per topic week (same theme, different author / scope / register), iterates on instructor feedback, assembles a finished alternative syllabus.
- **Slide-deck refresh.** Skill reads an existing slide deck, generates 2–3 replacement slides per slot (same content, different visual approach), iterates, assembles.
- **Problem-set generation for a course.** Same as make-up exam, applied to weekly problem sets. The security concern is lower (recall isn't a threat) but the parity concern is identical (same difficulty, same skills, same coverage).
- **Patient-case bank generation for health-professions education.** Same shape: generate clinical cases that test the same diagnostic skills as existing reference cases, with different presentations.
- **Code-review test suite refresh.** Same shape: regenerate test cases that probe the same code paths as existing ones, with different inputs.
- **Interview-question bank rotation.** Same shape: generate replacement interview questions that test the same competencies as existing ones, with sufficient distinctness that candidates who've heard the originals gain no advantage.

The constants across all of these:

1. A single source-of-truth artifact (the existing exam, syllabus, deck, case bank).
2. A multi-round candidate-curation loop driven by file-state, not chat-state.
3. An interview-phase calibration step before bulk generation.
4. A *Suitability* commitment per candidate — what's preserved, what's changed, in one sentence.
5. An audit-trail preservation rule (consumed feedback as quoted blocks).
6. A sanity-checked assembly step that matches the original's format.

Candidate operations a workshop attendee could add against the same architecture (in a separate skill that *uses* the make-up generator):

- **`exam-make-up-with-grading-rubric`** — produces a make-up that includes a per-subpart grading rubric in addition to the solutions. Adapts assembly mode.
- **`exam-make-up-statistics`** — runs the OCR/extraction step + statistics aggregation (word counts, concept distribution) over the make-up exam, comparing to the original. Adapts the deterministic-text-analysis pattern from [`text-analysis-and-datavis`](../text-analysis-and-datavis/).
- **`exam-make-up-difficulty-calibration`** — independent skill that estimates difficulty of a generated candidate by attempting to solve it from scratch and timing the attempt.

---

## Alignment constraints (the hard ones)

These come from the skill itself and survive translation to any curation-style skill:

- **Never modify the original.** Read-only access to the source artifact.
- **The instructor curates; the skill proposes.** Multi-round candidate loops, not autonomous regeneration.
- **A single file drives state.** Don't add a JSON state-store or a separate metadata file. The editable artifact IS the state.
- **The interview phase happens once, before generation.** Bulk-generating without calibration produces clone-y candidates.
- **Suitability is one sentence per candidate.** Longer rationales encourage reading instead of deciding.
- **Preserve consumed feedback as a quoted block** across iteration rounds. The file is the curation log.
- **Concrete, gradable subparts only.** No vague "explain why this matters" subparts.
- **Sanity-check assembly before reporting success.** Format-specific checks (balanced environments, typo'd-tag regex, problem-count verification).
- **One artifact per invocation.** Don't batch across multiple exams / syllabi / decks.
- **Trust contract: read the artifact, surface uncertainty, ask before guessing.** If the source's structure is ambiguous, stop and ask. A make-up exam built on a misread test plan is worse than no draft.
