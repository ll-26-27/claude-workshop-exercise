# Claude Code — Commands & Concepts

A short reference for everyday work in Claude Code. The first half defines the
**concepts** you'll keep hearing (skills, MCPs, CLAUDE.md, subagents); the second
half is the **slash command** list worth keeping nearby.

> Remember the through-line from Day 1: *almost all of this is just text.* Skills,
> commands, CLAUDE.md, even most "tools" are text files Claude reads. Get the right
> text in front of it and it behaves the way you want.

## Concepts

### CLAUDE.md
A plain markdown file that acts as an **automatic, project-level system prompt**.
Every time you start a session in a folder, Claude reads the `CLAUDE.md` at the root
(and walks *up* the folder tree, reading any others along the way, up to your home
directory). Use it to ground the model in *your* reality — who you are, the kind of
work you produce, terms of art in your field, conventions to follow.

- It's just text. One sentence ("always end with a limerick") changes behavior for
  an entire folder of work.
- Edit it, **save it**, and **open a new session** for changes to take effect.
- Generate a starter one with `/init`.

### Skills
A **reusable, packaged capability** you (or Anthropic) can give Claude — a folder
with a `SKILL.md` (instructions Claude follows) plus any supporting files or scripts.
Skills load *on demand*: Claude reads the short description, and when a task matches,
it pulls in the full instructions. Think of them as saved expertise for recurring
jobs ("draft a rubric this way," "format a handout in our house style") so you don't
re-explain every time.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
A **standard way to connect Claude to outside tools and data** — your files, a
database, a web browser, an institutional system, etc. An *MCP server* exposes a set
of actions Claude can call. Where a skill is *knowledge*, an MCP is usually a
*connection* to something live. You add the ones you need; Claude then has new
abilities (e.g., "search this database," "control a browser").

### Subagents
A **separate Claude working in the background** on a focused task, with its own fresh
context window. The main session hands off a job ("research X across these files,"
"review this draft"), the subagent does the work without cluttering your main
conversation, and reports back just the result. Useful for big searches or parallel
work — you keep the conclusion, not the mess.

### Plan Mode
A working mode where Claude **researches and proposes a plan before changing
anything**. You toggle it on (Shift+Tab), describe what you want, and Claude reads,
thinks, and comes back with a step-by-step plan for your approval — nothing is
written or run until you say go. The safest way to start any non-trivial task, and a
natural fit for the idea that *a good plan is itself the deliverable.*

### Slash commands
**Shortcuts you type to control the session** rather than to talk to the model.
A command is only recognized at the **start** of a message; anything after it is
passed along as arguments. Type `/` in a session to see what's available. The most
useful ones are listed below.

## Commands worth knowing

Notation: `<arg>` = required · `[arg]` = optional.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/init` | Generate a starter `CLAUDE.md` so Claude understands the project. **Run this first in a new folder/codebase.** |
| `/clear` | Start a fresh context window — drop the current conversation and begin clean. (Cheap, and often the right move when a thread gets long or goes sideways.) |
| `/compact [instructions]` | Summarize the conversation to free up context **without losing the thread**. Optionally focus the summary. |
| `/context [all]` | Visualize where your context window is going, with warnings and tips. Pairs with `/compact`. |
| `/rewind` | Roll code and/or conversation back to an earlier checkpoint. *(aliases: `/checkpoint`, `/undo`)* |
| `/resume [session]` | Return to an earlier conversation by ID/name, or open the picker. *(alias: `/continue`)* |
| `/branch [name]` | Fork the current conversation, preserving the original to return to later. *(alias: `/fork`)* |
| `/btw <question>` | Ask a quick side question **without** bloating the main conversation history. |
| `/usage` | Session cost, plan limits, and activity stats. *(aliases: `/cost`, `/stats`)* |
