# Context Engineering

> **In one line:** Context engineering is the deliberate practice of choosing what
> Claude can see — and what it can't — so it does its best work.

## In plain terms

Once you know that every answer comes only from the [context](context.md), that the
[context window](context-window.md) is finite, and that clutter causes
[context rot](context-rot.md), one skill follows from all three: **deciding, on
purpose, what to put in front of Claude.** That's context engineering.

It's less like programming and more like preparing a good briefing for a sharp
assistant:

- Give it the materials that matter (the actual reading, the real spreadsheet) —
  not a vague summary.
- Leave out what doesn't (old drafts, unrelated tangents).
- Write down standing instructions once, where Claude will reliably see them —
  this is what [CLAUDE.md](claude-md.md) and [Skills](skill-md.md) are for.
- Start fresh when the task changes, instead of dragging old context along.

This workshop's framing: it's the **single most powerful lever** for high-quality
output — more than clever wording in any one prompt.

## Why it matters in this workshop

It's the through-line. The web UI, [Claude Code](claude-code.md), the
Inputs → Operations → Outputs triptych, [CLAUDE.md](claude-md.md), Skills — each is
a concrete way of doing context engineering well. Participants who internalize this
idea can transfer it everywhere.
