# Model (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku)

> **In one line:** "The model" is the specific version of Claude doing the thinking;
> Claude comes in a few — Opus, Sonnet, Haiku — that trade off depth against speed.

## In plain terms

"Claude" is the assistant; **the model** is the particular engine behind it on a
given task. [Anthropic](anthropic.md) offers a small family, and the names follow a
poetry theme by length:

- **Opus** — the most capable and thorough; best for hard, high-stakes work.
  Slower and more expensive.
- **Sonnet** — a strong middle: very capable, noticeably faster. A good default for
  most work.
- **Haiku** — the fastest and lightest; great for quick, simple, high-volume tasks.

The names also carry a version number (e.g. "Opus 4.7"); higher is newer and more
capable. You'll sometimes choose a model from a menu; often a sensible default is
picked for you.

The beginner takeaway is just the trade-off intuition: **bigger model = more depth,
less speed; smaller = faster, lighter.** Match the model to the job — you don't need
the heaviest one to reformat a list.

## Why it matters in this workshop

It explains the model-picker menu and demos where the same prompt behaves
differently (e.g. a smaller model fumbling the multiplication example in
[outline/03](../outline/03-llm-basics-and-context.md)). Reduces "which one do I
pick?" anxiety.
