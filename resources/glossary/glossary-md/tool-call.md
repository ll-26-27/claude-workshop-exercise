# Tool Call

> **In one line:** A tool call is when Claude, instead of just writing an answer,
> *does something* — runs code, reads a file, fetches a page — and uses the result.

## In plain terms

A plain [LLM](llm.md) only predicts text. That alone can't reliably multiply large
numbers or know what's in your folder. **Tool calls** are how Claude steps outside
pure text prediction: it can reach for a tool, get a real result, and continue with
that result in hand.

Two kinds you'll see early in the workshop:

1. **Doing something exactly** — e.g. writing and running a snippet of code to do
   arithmetic. The earlier multiplication failure disappears, because now it's
   *computing*, not *guessing*.
2. **Grounding in real material** — e.g. opening the actual reading or spreadsheet
   so the answer is based on *your* document, not a plausible-sounding average.

You usually don't invoke tools yourself; Claude decides a task needs one and you see
it happen ("reading file…", "running…"). The idea to hold onto: **Claude can act,
not just talk — and acting is what makes it accurate and grounded.**

This is also the foundation of an [agent](agent.md): an agent is largely Claude
choosing and chaining tool calls toward a goal. When *you* stage the steps instead
of Claude, the same idea shows up as [prompt chaining](prompt-chaining.md) — each
prompt can include the results of an earlier tool call.

## Why it matters in this workshop

It resolves the tension set up in [outline/03](../outline/03-llm-basics-and-context.md):
the model is unreliable at some things *until* it can use tools. Tool calls are
*why* code and folder access make Claude trustworthy for real work.
